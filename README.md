# mysqlogin

A simple login and log up application written in Flutter and PHP. That uses MySQL queries and server connection.

Flutter side is not actually worked in some situations. It needs a localhost database connection without any password security (neither native_sql_connection nor chipher_sha2_secure)

So I rewrite them up in PHP as well.
